1. Create HTML with input, div with 2x span including numbers and txt, 3 buttons: player 1, player2, and reset
2. UI controller with dynamic numbers (what is the result, and how many rounds, and will change color if someon wins)
3. Back controller - it will count the numbers of win round, wiill get data from input, will block round numbers if max is reached. Will reset the score.
that's all for now
4. Add canvas - animation when someone is winning
